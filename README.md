### Hello there!

I'm Tjandra (yeah, you probably already saw my name).

By the way, I do mobile apps programming. I used to do it with Kotlin, but now I am planning to use Flutter as my main tool. Some other things I could do :
  1. Data Analysis, I can spend some of my time playing with Excel & Jupyter Notebook
  2. Linux Scripting, well I'm an active Linux user so it might as well be one of my skills
  3. Cyber Security, I'm studying Cyber Sec in a bootcamp program right now. So, I might need some time to master this skill.

If you do have an interest with my profile, reach me at
  +62 812 9413 9214 (WhatsApp & Telegram), or
  tjandradarmo@protonmail.com / t.darmo.t@gmail.com

I'm open with any collaboration opportunity, so feel free to ask me!
